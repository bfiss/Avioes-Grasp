The format of these data files is:
number of planes (p), freeze time
for each plane i (i=1,...,p):
   appearance time, earliest landing time, target landing time,
   latest landing time, penalty cost per unit of time for landing
   before target, penalty cost per unit of time for landing
   after target
   for each plane j (j=1,...p): separation time required after 
                                i lands before j can land
